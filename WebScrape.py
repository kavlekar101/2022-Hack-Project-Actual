'''
    So basically what I need to do now is
    (For current, which is needed)
    -> Refactoring the code
        -> it should only changes the room number
        -> perhaps adding more documentation for the code
        -> separate into different files so that it is more readable
    -> add inputs for the user to find certain timings and days
    -> implement the checkbox feature so that we can do multiple days
    -> add a sleep timer so that we can make it more "human like"
    -> test the code to make sure that it works as intended

    (Future features)
    -> maybe add something to allow you to find the short form of a building name
        -> figure out how to do this so that I can do the next one
    -> provide the amenities of the room by going to the classroom search thingy (this would be very cool to do)
        -> do a search based on what are needed (this would also be interesting)
    -> maybe add regex to make sure that the inputs are correct
    -> reach out to the people that handle this website and talk to them about this thing
    -> split up the list and create n drivers that run concurrently on different websites
    -> maybe talk to max about it
    -> create a GUI that visualizes the information
    -> make a web app that allows other users to put in which rooms they have reserved (FCFS basis)
        -> could change this to make a need basis (for interview or something)
        -> allow people/teachers to say when their classes are closed so that those rooms are marked as open
    -> something location based (i.e. I want an open room within a x mile radius/5 min walk because of my schedule)
        -> This is also interesting!
        -> say distance from your current location or future location
    -> classroom hopping if you are about to get kicked out of a current one
        -> chain together the searches so that you can find ones for a certain time block
    -> something that allows you to find multiple buildings and give you all of the results
    -> ranking system of the available rooms (based on whatever you want)
        -> could be based on amenities, location, time period available, etc.
    -> merge the availablity based on holidays, so if there is a holiday or a weekend, then the buildings are probably not open
    -> could extend this to more study spots in general for example the library

    (For a different implementation)
    -> implement something that allows users to find what rooms are open during what times
        -> We can use the leetcode question for the intervals
    -> try to implement in javascript for webapp or even in ruby
